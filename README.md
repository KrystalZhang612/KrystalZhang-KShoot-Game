A classic Android-style shooting game using PyGame and Python. It is a classic arcade-styled game filled with 3 different enemies of varying speeds and sizes that give the player progressively more points as the games get more difficult. I created three game modes where the player can see how fast to clear the entire game in free play mode, then in accuracy mode where the player has limited ammo to get as many points as they possibly can. The highest scoring is tracked and saved in an external text file that the player can reset from the menu screen if they ever want to start over the game. The player will LEVEL UP to the higher levels if they get enough scores.
